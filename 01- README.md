R code for thesis paper.

Hi there.
It is a repository related to a thesis paper titled "Comparison Performance of the Bayesian Approach with the Weibull and Birnbaum-Saunders Distributions in Imputation of Time-to-Event Censors". 
The repository includes command codes written in R, and R-markdown, output of R-markdown codes in HTML and PDF formatand, and two excell (csv) data reported by R-studio for scenarios 1, and 2

Note:
There is two datasets named "Convergence-Total", and "convergence data - BC" to run part 5-4 in the codes. It's necessary to paste these datasets in working directory. 
Regards.
